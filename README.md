### Hi there :smile:


Hey, This is Roshan Rajesh. I'm a IIIrd year student pursuing Computer Science with specialization in IT in SRMIST, Kattankulathur Campus.

I've a good idea in computer languages such as C, C++ and Python. I'm in the pursuit of learning more and increasing my knowledge in other 
languages like Java, HTML and CSS. I also work on increasing my knowledge through platforms like Coursera and Udemy. I'm doing additional 
courses like MATLAB and also improving on hardware programming using Raspberry PI. I practise competitive programming using C/C++/Python
